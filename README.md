# TensorFlowDataAPI

In this project we will learn how to convert images to serialized Example protbuf and save them to multiple TFRecord Files. In the process we will also learn how to use various methods provided by TensorFlow's Data API. 

We will then create test, train and validation datasets by reading from the above TFRecord files and training a small dense neural network to classify the images.
